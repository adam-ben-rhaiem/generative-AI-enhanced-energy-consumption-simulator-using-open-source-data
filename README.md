# 🔋 Energy Consumption Simulator

The **Energy Consumption Simulator** is a data-driven project designed to replicate and simulate energy usage patterns for households and businesses. It leverages open-source datasets and machine learning models to help users understand, analyze, and optimize their energy consumption across different scenarios such as seasonal changes, household behaviors, appliance usage, and adoption of green technologies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This simulator enables:

- Realistic simulation of hourly/daily/weekly energy consumption.
- Scenario modeling (e.g., adding solar panels, using electric vehicles, shifting peak usage).
- Visualization of consumption patterns.
- Appliance-level energy disaggregation and clustering.
- Synthetic data generation for research, policy modeling, or energy efficiency studies.

## 📊 Datasets Used

This project relies on publicly available, open-source datasets, including:

- [REFIT Electrical Load Measurements](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/datasets/refit-electrical-load-measurements-cleaned): Power usage data from UK homes at 8-second intervals.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn** – data wrangling and ML
- **TimeSeriesKMeans / TSlearn** – clustering time-series energy patterns
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – for development and experimentation

## 🛠 Features

- 📈 **Simulation Engine**: Generate synthetic energy profiles for various user-defined parameters.
- 🔍 **Clustering & Pattern Discovery**: Uncover typical consumption patterns across homes or appliances.
- 📦 **Appliance-Level Modeling**: Track and simulate the behavior of individual appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, kettles, etc.
